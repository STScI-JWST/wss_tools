.. _doc_mosaicauto:

MosaicAuto
==========

This local plugin is only used in ``MOSAIC`` mode, as defined in
:ref:`quip-doc-ginga-files`; particularly, the ``THUMBNAIL`` operation type.

It is very much like
:ref:`MosaicAuto in stginga <stginga:local-plugin-mosaicauto>` except that
the image list associated with the selected footprint(s) is written out to
"QUIP Out" as given by the "QUIP Operation File".

.. automodule:: wss_tools.quip.plugins.MosaicAuto
